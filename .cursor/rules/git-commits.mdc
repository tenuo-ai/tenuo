# Git Commit Rules

- NEVER add `--trailer` flags to git commits
- NEVER add `Co-authored-by`, `Signed-off-by`, or any other trailers
- Keep commit messages clean with just the message content

```bash
# ❌ BAD
git commit --trailer "Co-authored-by: ..." -m "message"

# ✅ GOOD
git commit -m "message"
```
