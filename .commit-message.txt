feat!: SignedApproval envelope + CBOR hashes + canonical errors

BREAKING CHANGES:

1. SignedApproval Envelope Pattern
   - Removed old flat Approval struct (Python API)
   - Added SignedApproval, ApprovalPayload, ApprovalMetadata
   - Updated all APIs: DataPlane, ControlPlane, Authorizer
   - Consistent with SignedWarrant design principles
   - Rust: Deprecated old Approval, kept for backward compat
   - Python: Complete removal, no backward compatibility

2. CBOR in compute_request_hash()
   - Changed from JSON to CBOR for deterministic hashing
   - Guarantees cross-language compatibility (Rust ↔ Python)
   - Existing approval hashes will differ (cannot migrate)
   - Ensures canonical encoding for all cryptographic ops

FEATURES:

- Canonical error codes (1000-2199) across all integrations
  - Single source of truth in Rust ErrorCode enum
  - Automatic derivation of HTTP status, JSON-RPC codes
  - Python decorator pattern (@wire_code) for clean registration
  - All integrations expose structured errors with wire codes

- Bidirectional wildcard patterns (*mid*, prefix-*-suffix)
  - Support for complex glob patterns in matching
  - Conservative equality-only attenuation for security
  - Comprehensive test coverage (Rust + Python)

- Pattern ** reserved/discouraged for security
  - Documented security risks of overly broad permissions
  - Recommended alternatives (Wildcard() for unrestricted)

- PoP configuration alignment
  - Spec now matches implementation: max_windows=5 (±60s)
  - Corrected all tolerance calculations
  - Updated documentation across specs

TESTS:

- Added 17+ new tests (Rust + Python)
- All tests passing: 299/299 Rust tests
- Comprehensive approval envelope tests (12 tests)
- CBOR determinism tests
- Bidirectional pattern tests (5 tests)
- Error code registry tests
- Updated security tests for envelope pattern

DOCUMENTATION:

- Comprehensive breaking change guide (BREAKING-CHANGE-SignedApproval.md)
- Updated wire format specification (v1)
  - Approval envelope pattern
  - Bidirectional wildcards section
  - Pattern ** security guidance
  - Error codes moved to Appendix A
  - Verbosity improvements
- Updated all integration docs (FastAPI, LangChain, LangGraph, MCP, OpenAI, Google ADK, A2A)
- Removed outdated docs/_internal/full-spec.md
- Added design decision docs for reference

FIXES:

- Fixed unused imports in python.rs
- Fixed clippy warnings (redundant_closure, manual_div_ceil)
- Removed py_compute_approval_hash (no longer needed)
- Updated all test fixtures to use envelope pattern
- Cargo.lock sync

FILES CHANGED:
- Core Rust: 10 files (approval, planes, python, constraints, error, authorizer, etc.)
- Python: 5 files (exceptions, a2a/errors, fastapi, __init__, tests)
- Tests: 6 files (3 new: test_approval_envelope.py, test_exception_wire_codes.py, test_a2a_error_codes.py)
- Documentation: 15 files (specs + integration docs + breaking change guide)
- Total: 36+ files

This release significantly improves security, consistency, and cross-language compatibility
while providing clear migration paths for breaking changes.
